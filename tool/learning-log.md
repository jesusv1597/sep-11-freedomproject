* [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) (For my first learning log I tinkered with my tool by following Kaboom.js's website, I experimented with the "playground" section)
* I tinkered within my console a little and although I don't think I have much figured out I did manage to figure out how to change the positioning and coloring of a sprite, and I played around with having multiple entities/sprites on the screen.
* [Freecodecamp Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM1iSvloMlo&t=434s) This was a cool video that I saw and that I watched a little bit of in order to just get a grasp at free code camps full potential.
* I really wanted to check out ways to import or design my own sprites for my own little platformer game, but I feel like it would be best to just figure out the basics and to design atleast a portion of my game's world before I create all the cosmetic stuff like sprites.
