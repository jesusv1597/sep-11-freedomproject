### Content

The tool I decided to use for my freedom project was Kaboom.js, Kaboom.js is a software that allows for easier access to making games such as platformers. I chose this tool because it looked like it would be the best fit for my project and also because it just seemed like the funnest out of the other tools and I feel like i've made the right choice, although, I will admit that at first it seemed a little intimidating to me, but I now feel like I could learn it if I really put effort into it. 

### Tinkering

I tinkered with my tool by visiting the [Playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) section of Kaboom, what this allowed me to do was just view a bunch of the things you can do with Kaboom, there was also some code that I found in the tutorial section of kaboom that I copied into my console in order to make a little sprite, this helped me sort of understand how Kaboom sprites would work. Through this, I found out that the sprites act sort of like CSS shapes, wherein they can be moved via numbers that tell us what their positioning is.
