### Content

The tool I decided to use for my freedom project was Kaboom.js, Kaboom.js is a software that allows for easier access to making games such as platformers. I chose this tool because it looked like it would be the best fit for my project and also because it just seemed like the funnest out of the other tools and I feel like i've made the right choice, although, I will admit that at first it seemed a little intimidating to me, but I now feel like I could learn it if I really put effort into it. 

### Tinkering

I tinkered with my tool by visiting the [Playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) section of Kaboom, what this allowed me to do was just view a bunch of the things you can do with Kaboom, there was also some code that I found in the tutorial section of kaboom that I copied into my console in order to make a little sprite, this helped me sort of understand how Kaboom sprites would work. Through this, I found out that the sprites act sort of like CSS shapes, wherein they can be moved via numbers that tell us what their positioning is. 

I also watched some videos on Kaboom.js, this was just to get a grasp of what can be done using Kaboom, the video I watched that really stood out to me was one by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM1iSvloMlo&t=434s). The video is 4 hours long but I didn't watch all of it, I just skimmed through some parts. 

### My Idea

I am going to be making a platformer game using Kaboom, and, I really want it to stand out, or atleast be different from other people's as, I know that a lot of other people are going to be using Kaboom.js so I want to have a project that is different and that has different features, even if it does make it harder. What I want to do for my project is to have a standard platformer game, 2d, and with foes, but I want to implement a sort of grappling feature that allows the player to grapple from one area to another, I want to make the player a monkey and I want to have the monkeys hands stretch far, allowing them to grab onto a surface and slowly be pulled there. I wanted the grappel thing to be sort of like a rope, this would mean that some sort of physics engine would have to be implemented to have the player swing from place to place, and I'm not really sure if an engine like that can be found within Kaboom. I would have to do a little more tinkering to figure that out.
